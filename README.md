# Mock Interview Assistant 🤖

An AI-powered assistant that helps users prepare for technical interviews by:
- Generating domain-specific interview questions
- Accepting text, voice, and resume inputs
- Providing instant AI-generated feedback
- Visualizing skill gaps and progress
- Supporting RAG, CoT, LoRA, and multimodal reasoning
